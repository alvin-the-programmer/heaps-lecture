MaxHeaps
    - Binary Tree
    - at any node, it's children are guaranteed to be less than or eq to the node
    - the root of a maxheap will be the true maximum value
    - a max heap is a partially sorted data structure

Example Problem:
    - given an array, find the k largest values in the array

MaxHeaps are easier to maintain than BSTs

Our maxheap math:
    - using a 1-index array
    - given a parent val at index i:
        - it's left child is 2i
        - it's right child is 2i + 1
    - given a child val at index i:
        - it's parent is at index Math.floor(i / 2)

You could also:
    - use a 0-index array
        - given a parent val at index i
        - it's left child 2i + 1
        - it's right child 2i + 2
